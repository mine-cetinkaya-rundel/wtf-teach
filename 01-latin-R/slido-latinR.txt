regular expression (strings regex)
At the beginning there was a lot of information on the internet and I didn't know where to start learning
Too much focus on rules, syntax and the "mechanics" of the language, and not much about what we could actually do with the language, what we could build, why were we learning all those rules, what was the underlying philosophy of the language and why those "mechanics" were set up in that particular way.
To find good examples for complicated topics; e.g. * pointers or dynamic memory in C * cleaning data in R / python
understanding the difference between data frame and matrix
gather and spread
I don't know any programming language
Understand chunks
The most challenging was indeed the logic. I was not taught about "ifs", "loops"... Etc before my first programming course.
Getting stuck due to errors (e. g. when setting up the environment) that even the instructor couldn't solve
We are going to learn how to print "Hello World"
Async programming
Setup / installation
The fact that sometimes the speaker makes references to obvious knowledge
Loops. Using basic. 1986
I didn't spoke English at the time ...
For R, it was starting with the boring and most difficult stuff first
Change the way of thinking the elements in the program
Thinking in terms of algorithms for the first time
Do it sth myself, without copy paste...
Sometimes they wouldn't explain why things would work in R, because it was in a class of statistics
technology setup :p
The logic
Having to write a code from scratch (blank page)
It was when teacher explains in technical terms which he only knew.
They didn't consider the learning curve.
I had nobody to talk to and StackOverflow did not exist.
I didn't know what the purpose was
Understand error
It was a MOOC
My english is not very good
